# s&ers architectures

s&ers tries to be as accessible and usable as possible.
This includes being available on every platform possible.
s&ers should have support for every architecture that Rust supports either through the default LLVM code generator or through the [GCC code generator](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc).

> As of now, s&ers only supports x86_64.
> This is because it is still very new and in active development.
> Once it is able to function as a full kernel and is relatively stable, other platforms can begin to get more attention.
> Until then, however x86_64 is the focus.
